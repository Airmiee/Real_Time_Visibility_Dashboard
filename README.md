# Real_Time_Visibility_Dashboard

### Description:
This company offers global digital skill acquisition services, with centers in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria and needs an optimized business process to enhance revenue and customer satisfaction. 

### Features:
* Dashboard:
User-friendly, real-time data tracking and display.
* Technologies Used:
Power BI (ETL and Power Query) for data cleaning and transformation.

### Observations:
During the project, a significant structural change in data management was implemented, which enhanced the ETL process for our Real-Time Visibility Decision Support System. This improvement was pivotal for enabling the system to deliver accurate insights and support informed decision-making. The successful execution of this change management project highlighted the importance of robust data structures in optimizing system performance and driving business value.

### Design Thinking: 
Management's focus on increasing conversion rates generated which increases revenue. I created a payment date collation progress bar to track how efficiently payment dates were entered into our database once payments were made.

### Components of the Dashboard:
* Total Revenue: Graphs showing revenue by day, month, quarter, and year.
* Revenue by Location: Detailed revenue breakdowns by location.
* Conversion Rate: Charts displaying conversion rates by year.

### Conclusion:
The dashboard has been instrumental in increasing registration rates by 75%, demonstrating a significant improvement in our opportunity funnel. To capitalize on this momentum and ensure robust revenue growth by the end of the quarter, the company must mandate collaboration between the sales and marketing units. Specifically, a target of registering more than one hundred candidates per month has been recommended as a critical metric. This proactive approach will not only sustain the current growth trajectory but also position the company for sustained success in future quarters.
